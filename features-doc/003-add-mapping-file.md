# Add mapping file

Since we have to scrape the ps store website and the backloggd website, we have to add a mapping file to map the games from the ps store website to the backloggd website for certain games.

There are some games that are the same game but they have different titles in the ps store website and the backloggd website.
We have to add a mapping file in order to know these games and map them to the correct game in the backloggd website.

Propose a file structure for that mapping file and implement it. Create a few examples of games that are the same game but have different titles in the ps store website and the backloggd website.
