# Notifications

We will use the Telegram API to send notifications to a Telegram channel when the script is run.
We want to send a final notification with the changes to be made to the backloggd list.
If everything is fine we also want a notification with a success message.
Telegram main function is to notify the human maintainer of the changes to be made to the backloggd list.

Twitter main function is to notify the community about the new updates.
We want to create a twitter post with the new additions on the backloggd list.
In case that there is more than one addition we want to create a twitter post per addition.
